UPDATE: 11:30pm 10/6/2010

Bugs:
	- Can jump yourself
	- Issue with trying to jump opponent backwards (shouldn't do anything, but removes piece, yet you retain turn?)

Still need to add the following features:
	- Kings
	- Multi-jumps
	- Game over/winner notification
	
Would like to add:
	- Turn into jQuery plugin w/ options
	- Better graphics
	- Cleaner CSS
	- Compression
        - AI Opponent

I still need to refactor stuff a bit to make the functions prettier (ugly right now since I'm drinking with my roommate and watching Futurama :)
